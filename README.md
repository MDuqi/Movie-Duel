# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Duel

**Movie Duel** is a fun and interactive web application designed to help you and a friend (or partner!) choose a movie based on a randomly selected theme. It features an animated theme carousel, a draw mechanism, and two movie suggestionsâ€”one for each person.

This project began as a playful way to practice JavaScript while finding an easier and more engaging way to pick movies with my girlfriend.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Idea

- A theme is drawn at random from a CSV file via a spinning carousel animation.
- The user can **redraw** or **accept** the selected theme.
- Once the theme is accepted, two movie options are displayed:
  - One picked by Person A
  - One picked by Person B  
- Both movies relate to the selected theme, encouraging a fun "movie duel".
- The process can then be repeated to draw a new theme.
